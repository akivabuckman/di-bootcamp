-- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Bootcamp
-- Instructions
-- For this exercise, you will have to find some requests on your own!



-- Create
-- Create a database called bootcamp.
-- Create a table called students.
-- Add the following columns:
-- id
-- last_name
-- first_name
-- birth_date
-- The id must be auto_incremented.
-- Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
-- To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)


-- Here is the data:

-- id	first_name	last_name	birth_date
-- 1	Marc	Benichou	02/11/1998
-- 2	Yoan	Cohen	03/12/2010
-- 3	Lea	Benichou	27/07/1987
-- 4	Amelia	Dux	07/04/1996
-- 5	David	Grez	14/06/2003
-- 6	Omer	Simpson	03/10/1980


-- Insert
-- Insert the data seen above to the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.
-- Insert your last_name, first_name and birth_date to the students table (Take a look at the id given).


-- Select
-- Fetch all of the data from the table.
-- Fetch all of the students first_names and last_names.
-- For the following questions, only fetch the first_names and last_names of the students.
-- Fetch the student which id is equal to 2.
-- Fetch the student whose last_name is Benichou AND first_name is Marc.
-- Fetch the students whose last_names are Benichou OR first_names are Marc.
-- Fetch the students whose first_names contain the letter a.
-- Fetch the students whose first_names start with the letter a.
-- Fetch the students whose first_names end with the letter a.
-- Fetch the students whose second to last letter of their first_names are a (Example: Leah).
-- Fetch the students whose idâ€™s are equal to 1 AND 3 .

-- Fetch the students whose birth_dates are equal to or come after 1/01/2000. (show all their info).

set datestyle to 'dmy'; -- because dates are given in this format
-- insert into students (first_name, last_name, birth_date)
-- values
-- ('Marc', 'Benichou', '02/11/1998'),
-- ('Yoan', 'Cohen', '03/12/2010'),
-- ('Lea', 'Benichou', '27/07/1987'),
-- ('Amelia', 'Dux', '07/04/1996'),
-- ('David', 'Grez', '14/06/2003'),
-- ('Omer', 'Simpson', '03/10/1980');
-- insert into students (last_name, first_name, birth_date)
-- values ('Buckman', 'Akiva', '02/05/1991');

select * from students;

select first_name, last_name from students;

select first_name, last_name from students where id = 2;

select first_name, last_name from students where last_name = 'Benichou' and first_name = 'Marc';

select first_name, last_name from students where last_name = 'Benichou' or first_name = 'Marc';

select first_name, last_name from students where first_name ilike '%a%';

select first_name, last_name from students where first_name ilike 'a%';

select first_name, last_name from students where first_name ilike '%a_';

select first_name, last_name from students where id = 1 and id = 3; -- the exercise says AND, which is impossible for an entry so returns empty table

select * from students where birth_date >= '01/01/2000';
