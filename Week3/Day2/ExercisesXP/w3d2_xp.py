#         self.animals = animals
#
#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:

# class Bengal(Cat):

#
# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'
#
#
# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.
#
# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.
#

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking"

    def run_speed(self):
        return self.weight / self.age * 10

    def fight(self, opponent):
        if self.run_speed() > opponent.run_speed():
            print(f"{self.name} wins!")
        else:
            print(f"{opponent.name} wins!")

def xp2():
    al = Dog('al', 1, 12)
    bob = Dog('bob', 12, 111)
    carl = Dog('carl', 33, 122)
    dogs = [al, bob, carl]
    for index, dog in enumerate(dogs):
        dog.bark()
        dog.run_speed()
        dog.fight(dogs[(index + 1) % 3])

# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True
#
# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.
#
# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.
