-- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Items And Customers
-- Instructions
-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

-- Use SQL to get the following from the database:
-- All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
-- Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
-- The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) â€“ exclude the primary key column from the results.
-- All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)

select * from items order by item_price asc;

select * from items where item_price >= 80 order by item_price desc;

select first_name, last_name from customers order by first_name asc limit 3;

select last_name from customers order by last_name desc;
