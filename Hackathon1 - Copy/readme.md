This is a recipe management program where users can store their favorite recipes. They can do this either by inputting their own recipes, or searching online for a recipe using an API. They can then unfavorite a recipe they decide they don’t like, and they also have the option of emailing a file of the recipe to themselves. In addition, the program has a user management system, with login and password validation.

Some tools used:
OOP, including inheritance and polymorphism
API called "Edamam" for recipe searches
Tkinter for all UI
Psycopg2 to access pgAdmin databases
SMTPLib and MIME to create and send emails
Faker for fake login info
